# How To Joyce

Hello! 

My name is Joyce and I am an engineering manager.

Here is a how-to guide to help you understand my motivations and how I work. My hope is that this will help you navigate the potentially confusing paths of communication that can occur. 

## My Values

My focus is your overall success (even beyond $current_company)

* "career" part of "career development is a longer term concept, and let's work on figuring out how we can make your time at $current_company a building block that helps you progress on your preferred growth path

I believe in systems and habits

* I focus on creating systems (through process, etc.) that encourage sustainable habits as a team
* Good habits are key to our continued success as many factors continue to change

Team is the star of the show

* I love being able to bring together a group of individuals with varied strengths and become an awesome team that makes each other stronger and better
* my job is to create an environment that allows the team and the individuals on the team to succeed
* Basically, you’re the face of the team and my job is to make you look good

Collaboration always

* I prefer discussions and collaborative problem solving
* This requires visibility and transparency. (This is why I keep pushing for meeting notes)
* I like hearing from different perspectives and experiences
* I like asking questions
* I want to hear everyone’s insights and suggestions
* Cross-functional collaboration is a hill I’m willing to die on

Progress over perfrection

* I bias towards making imperfect improvements regularly
* We will fail at times, but let’s learn and carry on

Impact and Effort

* Work hard, but also work smart
* Let’s discuss how you can work in whatever way best suits you and the company

Have Fun

* I know this is corny and a bit 2nd-grade-teacher-telling-you-your-homework-for-the-weekend kind of feel, but it’s true!
* I am in large part here at this company because of the people I have the pleasure of working with. I fully appreciate their company by having fun as we work together


## Manager Stuff

1-on-1's

* 30 minutes
* Weekly or bi-weekly depending on your preference
* Substance not status
* I love career growth conversations
* To keep myself organized and accountable, I have a doc to keep notes of what we’ve talked about and upcoming topics to discuss. I will share this doc with you for collaborative use.

Meetings

* Meeting notes for transparency, visibility, and alignment
* Start meetings on time
* My calendar is public for a reason. Don’t hesitate to schedule time with me as needed
* I’m in a lot of meetings. Hopefully you aren’t. If there’s a meeting you’re curious about, chances are I have notes. Ask me

Communication

* I’m most responsive on Slack via DM
** Sometimes I’ll Slack you outside normal work hours. Treat as async. Does not mean I expect you to be online and responding at that time as well
* I do my best to stay updated on emails but longer turnaround time than Slack

Feedback

* Feedback is a practice we’ll practice
* Hold me accountable
* If you don’t feel comfortable coming directly to me, you can ask my manager to relay the feedback to me

Expectations

* Good performance is status quo
* You should feel like you are making an impact and feeling engaged
* If you or I feel this is not the case, let’s talk

Vacations

* I take vacations, you should too
* I expect you to be able to manage the work that needs to be done before those vacations

## Quirks and Tendencies

I am high energy and passionate

* I’m an extrovert
* I enjoy working actively with others
* I like having in-person/video-call meetings with people, but don’t hesitate to let me know if that’s not your preferred way of collaboration
* easily excited
* I want people to be enjoying themselves, feeling engaged, and feeling motivated

I enjoy PM work

* My first EM role was on a team with no PM, so I tend to assume some PM responsibilities automatically
* I enjoy the work and will contribute where I can, when it makes sense

I am a morning person

* sorry SF, you're welcome DC

I bias towards acton

* Problem solving is my default mode. This is how I feel I can help
* Sometimes that means I want to act too quickly. If I ever step on anyone’s toes, please let me know. That is never my intention
* I understand not everyone wants to be helped in this way so let’s work together to figure out how I can best support you

I enjoy organizing chaos

* That’s why start-ups are fun
* Ambiguity can be lots of fun
* I’m happiest when working on several things at once

I love feedback

* Honest, direct, immediate, constructive feedback
* Please be honest. Don't hesitate
* I feel relayed feedback (telephone) is less effective and actionable for me, so please encourage the individual to come straight to me if they can
* I want you to hold me accountable
* if I’m spending time on something that isn’t helpful, tell me
* if I forget to get back to you on something, tell me

I love what I do

* passionate about this work and get really excited about it
* I enjoy catching up on work outside normal work hours. treat as async. does NOT mean I expect you to be online and responding at that time as well
